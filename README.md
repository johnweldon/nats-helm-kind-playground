# NATS Playground using Kind and Helm

This repo is **deprecated** and archived - this was part of some experimental work, but is **not recommended** or supported.

## Installation

This will create the kind cluster, and deploy the nats helm chart on it.

```sh
./up
```

## Clean Up

This will uninstall the helm chart, and remove the kind cluster.

```sh
./down
```
